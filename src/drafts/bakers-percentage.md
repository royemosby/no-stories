## Baker's math

To scale up and down bread recipes, bakers often think in terms of ingredient ratios. By consensus, the amount of flour by weight, is the base by which to measure all other ingredients.

## Hydration rates of other ingredients

- Milk: 87% water
- Large eggs: 74% water (1 large shelled egg weighs 50g)
- Liquid sweeteners (e.g., honey): 17% water
- American-style butter: 16% water (varies by brand)
- European-style butter: 13% (varies by brand)
- Vegetable oil: 0% water (100% fat)
