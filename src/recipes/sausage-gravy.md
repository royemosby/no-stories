## Ingredients

- 16 oz pork breakfast sausage
- 1/2 medium white or sweet onion
- 1/2 jalapeno, seeded (add in pepper flakes if more heat desired)
- 3 tbsp flour
- 2 cups milk, with 1-2 in reserve for thickness preferences

## Hardware

- 10-12" skillet
- wooden spatula

## Instructions

1. Heat skillet to medium.
1. Chop onion medium fine and place into a small bowl. Dice jalapeño finely and place into separate small bowl.
1. Flatten sausage out across the bottom of the skillet and turn heat to medium-high.
1. Allow sausage to remain in place until evidence of browning starts to appear up the sides of broken areas on the meat. This allows the sausage to develop a little crispiness which improves texture.
1. Flip all of sausage over break up into crumbles.
1. When 95% of the sausage is cooked, pull the meat out from the center of the pan, making a well.
1. Pour onions in well and sautée. Mix meat around the edges to continue the cooking process.
1. Once onions start to take on a slight browning, mix into the sausage meat.
1. Add jalapeños and stir in. Allow to cook for 1-2 more minutes.
1. Even out contents of the skillet and then sprinkle flour across the top. Stir in until the whiteness of the flour disappears then allow to cook for another 2 minutes.
1. Slowly pour in 2 cups of milk, scraping any fond/flour that has built up on the bottom of the pan. Stir contents of the pan continuously for a minute.
1. When everything starts to bubble, turn pan to medium-low to prevent milk from scortching.
1. Add small amounts of reserved milk in while continuously stirring to thin out gravy. Do this until the desired thickness is reached. Too thick and the gravy will end up pasty and taste overwhelmingly of flour. A good indicator of doneness is to dip the back of a spoon into the gravy then pull it out. It should drip but a thin coating should remain on the spoon. When a line is drawn through the gravy with your finger (definately not your tongue) it should remain.
