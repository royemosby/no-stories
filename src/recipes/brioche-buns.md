## Instructions

1. In a glass measuring cup, combine one cup warm water, the milk, yeast and sugar. Let stand until foamy, about five minutes. Meanwhile, beat one egg in another bowl.
1. In a large bowl, whisk AP and BF with salt.
1. Add butter and rub into flour between your fingers, making crumbs.
1. Using a dough scraper, stir in yeast mixture and beaten egg until a dough forms.
1. Scrape dough onto clean, well-floured counter and knead, scooping dough up, slapping it on counter and turning it, until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. The dough will be on the sticky side so it can be a bit messy. Be warned that the more flour kneaded in, the tougher the buns will get. A stand mixer can be used at the low setting for 8 minutes instead of hand mixing.
1. Shape dough into a ball and turn into a greased bowl.
1. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, one to two hours.
1. Let proof until doubled in size, 1 - 1 1/2 hours.
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using dough scraper, divide dough into 10 equal parts. Gently roll each into a ball and arrange two to three inches apart on baking sheet. Cover loosely with a piece of plastic wrap lightly coated in nonstick spray and let buns rise in a warm place for one to two hours. **-or-** If making slide buns, dough into 15-20 small pieces, roll & place on baking sheet.
1. Cover loosely with plastic wrap coated in non-stick spray.
1. After 1 hour, uncover and prepare egg wash.
1. Preheat oven to 400F
1. Mix remaining egg with a pinch of salt then egg wash the buns. Sprinkle with sesame seeds at this time if desired.
1. Bake approximately 15 minutes or until golden brown on top. Turn pan 180° halfway through baking.
1. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.
