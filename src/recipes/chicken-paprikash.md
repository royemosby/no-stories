## Plan ahead

This recipe focuses on chicken paprikash. It is often served over some sort of starch- usually an egg noodle such as nokedli. This goes fine with the wide egg noodles bought in a grocery store.

## Directions

    - Cut chicken into 1" cubes into a bowl
    - Rough dice or french the onion into a separate bowl
    - Finely dice garlic and add to onion's bowl
    - Chop all cherry tomatoes in half
1. Heat pan to medium high, add in 1 tbsp olive oil
1. When hot, add in chicken, 1/2 tbsp sweet paprika and turn the temperature up to high.
1. Cook chicken until just finished through. Turning down temperature if the chicken starts to brown too drastically.

1. Sprinkle flour over onions and garlic. Mix until flour incorporates into the oil and no white flour remains visible.
1. Stir in chicken stock, halved cherry tomatoes, and remaining paprika. Let come up to heavy simmer for 5 minutes, stirring regularly.
1. Add chicken back in and reduce to a low simmer for 10 minutes or until sauce is thickened.
1. Remove from heat, stir in sour cream. Season with salt as desired.
