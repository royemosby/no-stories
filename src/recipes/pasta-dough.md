*This recipe can be easily doubled if using a stand mixer. In the future, I will add in the steps needed to form various types of pasta with this dough. For now, the specific pasta type is a DIY affair.*

## Ingredients

- 240 gr AP
- 3 eggs
- 1 tbsp EVOO
- 1 tsp salt

## Hardware

- stand mixer with dough hook (optional but convenient)
- spatula
- bench scraper (for portioning out dough)

## Instructions

1. In a stand mixer bowl, combine AP and salt. [^hand]
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and oil.
3. Turn mixer on low and slowly drizzle in egg/oil mixture.
4. After dough comes together into a shaggy mass (1 minute or so after the last of the egg/oil goes in), stop the mixer and scrape the sides down.
5. Turn mixer back to low and allow to knead for ten minutes.
6. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and give a few hand kneads.
7. Form into a ball and cover with bowl, allowing the dough to rest for 30 minutes.
8. Portion out the dough into 2 equal pieces. (4 if doubling recipe)
9. Form balls of the portions and cover for another 5-10 minutes.
10. Process into desired pasta type.

[^hand]: This dough can be brought together by hand as well. Instead of a stand mixer, one can use a wide bowl or even a counter. Make a well in the center pre-mixed flour and salt. Pour a small amount of the liquid into the well at center and pull flour into it, mixing it with finger tips. Slowly add more mixture and pulling more flour in, being careful to maintain the well. After all mixture is pulled in, hand-knead until dough is smooth- about 10-15 minutes.
