## Ingredients

### Dry

- 2 tsp active dry yeast
- 2 1/2 tbsp sugar
- 3 c bread flour (360 gr)
- 1/3 c all-purpose flour (60 gr)
- 1 1/2 tsp salt (5.9 gr)
- 2 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
- Sesame seeds (optional)

### Wet

- 3 tbsp warm milk
- 1 c warm water
- 2 large eggs

## Instructions

1. In a glass measuring cup, combine one cup warm water, the milk, yeast and sugar. Let stand until foamy- about five minutes. During the wait, beat one egg in small bowl until uniform.
1. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt with whisk. Add butter and rub into flour between your fingers, making crumbs.
1. Using a sturdy mixing spoon, stir in yeast mixture and beaten egg until a dough forms.
1. Scrape dough out onto a clean, well-floured counter and knead, until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. The dough will be on the sticky side so it can be a bit messy.
1. Shape dough into a ball and return it to bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, one to two hours. When placing plastic wrap, be sure that the dough will not come in contact with it during the rise. It will stick.
1. Let proof until doubled in size, between 1-2 hours.
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Divide dough into 8 equal parts by hand or with a bench scraper.
1. Gently roll each into a ball and arrange two to three inches apart on baking sheet.
1. Cover loosely with a piece of plastic wrap lightly coated in nonstick spray and let buns rise in a warm place for one to two hours.
1. Cut dough into 15-20 small pieces, roll & place on baking sheet
1. Cover loosely with plastic wrap coated in non-stick spray and let proof for another 1-2 hours.
1. Whisk second egg uniformly for an egg wash.
1. Remove plastic wrap carefully.
1. Brush with egg wash and optionally sprinkle with sesame seeds.
1. Set a large shallow pan of water on oven floor.
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees with rack in center.
1. Bake -turning sheet halfway through baking- until tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.
