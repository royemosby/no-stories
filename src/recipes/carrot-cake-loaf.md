## Ingredients

### Dry

- 1 3/4 c AP flour
- 1 tbsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp ginger
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp allspice
- 1/8 tsp clove
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 c chopped walnuts
- 1/2 c raisins

### Wet

- 1 c light brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 3 medium carrots, shredded finely
- 3/4 c canola oil
- 2 tsp vanilla

### Icing

- 8 oz marscapone
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3-4 tbsp milk.
- 2/3 - 1 1/2 c confectioners sugar

## Hardware

- whisk
- spatula
- bread tin
- parchment paper
- medium micro-plane grater or fine hole grater
- nonstick spray oil
- 3 bowls: 1 for wet, 1 for dry, and 1 for shredded carrots

### Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350F. Set out marscapone and 4 tbsp milk so that they are room temperature when you are ready to make the icing.
1. Line tin with parchment paper and spray inner surfaces with nonstick oil.
1. Peel and shred carrots into a medium bowl.
1. Mix all dry ingredients except walnuts and raisins into a large bowl.
2. Combine eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla in another bowl. Whisk vigorously for 2 minutes.
3. Add in oil and whisk until incorporated.
4. Switch to spatula and add in the dry mix, stirring until batter is well combined. It will be fairly thick in consistency.
5. Fold in grated carrot, walnuts, and raisins.
6. Transfer batter into prepared bread tin and spread out evenly.
7. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until a cake tester inserted at the middle comes out clean.
8. Allow to cool for 10 minutes in bread tin.
9. Remove cake from tin and cool to room temperature.
10. For icing, combine room temperature[^curdle] marscapone, 2 tbsp milk, vanilla, and confectioners sugar until smooth. Add additional milk until desired consistency is reached. We go with a thicker consistency where it sluggishly drizzles off the mixing utensil.
11. Drizzle icing across the top of the cooled cake. Eat on the spot or refrigerate up to 5 days.

[^curdle]: Marscapone tends to curdle when combined with ingredients of differing temperatures. If it does curdle, you can warm the mixture using the [double boiler](../../concepts/kitchen-glossary/#double-boil) technique or microwaving gently. After warmed, re-mix.
