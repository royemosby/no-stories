<p>Deglazing is the act of using a liquid (water, beer, wine, vinegar, etc) as a solvent to help scrape off cooked food from a hot cooking surface, such as the bottom of a pan. The resulting suspension, called fond, can be used as a part of a dish to lend it flavor. It's also a way to remove food from cookware, making cleanup easier.</p>
