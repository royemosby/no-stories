title: 'double boil'
---

Double boiling is the act of gently heating an ingredient indirectly with boiling water. This technique allows for the the gradual raising of temperature where over-heating would cause problems for the cook. It is most often used for melting chocolate but it has other applications.

<h2 class="tiny-heading">Tools needed</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3 or 4 quart pot</li>
  <li>1 heat-resistant bowl, slightly wider than the rim of the pot</li>
  <li>1 oven mit or vice-grip pliers</li>
  <li>Instant-read or other probe-style thermometer specific temperature is needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="tiny-heading">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Fill the pot with 1-2 inches of water then heat on high.</li>
  <li>Place chocolate, marscapone, or whatever needs heated into the metal bowl.</li>
  <li>If using vice-grips, affix them to the rim of the bowl. Using an oven mit works too but I much prefer the controll that the pliers afford. Steam will vent from around the bowl and will quickly burn unprotected skin.</li>
  <li>When the water starts boiling, rest the bowl on top of the pot.</li>
  <li>Stir gently and test with thermometer as required.</li>
</ol>
