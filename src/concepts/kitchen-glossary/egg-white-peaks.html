title: 'egg white peaks'
---

When beating egg whites, differing levels of stiffness are called for depending
on their used. As the mixer is pulled out of the foam it will leave behind
peaks. How these peaks maintain their shape indicate how stiff the egg whites
are. There are 4 levels:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No peaks:</strong> the egg white forms a fine, shiny foam that
    settles back into the mixture when the mixer is removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Soft peaks:</strong> the egg whites start to hold shape when the
    whisk pulls out. They create mounds that slowly sink back into the mixture
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Firm peak:</strong> the egg white peaks no longer settle back into
    the body of the mixture. The very end of the peak may curl back on itself
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stiff peaks:</strong> even firmer, the end of the peaks only
    partially curl back on themselves, if at all
  </li>
</ul>
As with cream, one can mix egg whites too far. After stiff peaks, further mixing
causes the protein structure inside the foam to tighten up. When this happens,
the foam will start expressing liquid into the bottom of the bowl.
