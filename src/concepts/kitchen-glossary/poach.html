title: poach
---
<p style="margin-top:0">Cooking in liquid such as wine, water, or milk at a relatively low temperature, below boiling. This technique is used to cook delicate foods such as eggs or fish. 
</p>
<p>It can also be used on ingredients that are going to be further processed for a final dish. An example of this is is chicken breast for chicken salad. Poaching cooks the chicken without causing undue contraction in the muscle's protein. This leaves the chicken breast moister than other cooking methods.</p>
